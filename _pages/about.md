I’m a second-year Master’s student in Mechatronics and Robotics at NYU, with a First-Class BE in Mechanical Engineering from Osmania University, India. I’m hooked on pushing tech limits—blending mechanical design and robotics to innovate in automotive, brain-computer interfaces, healthcare, wearables, and humanoid systems. My path’s all about delivering solutions that matter.

I’ve stacked hands-on wins across diverse roles. At [KIA India](https://www.kia.com/in/home.html), I cut [Carens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Carens#Fourth_generation_(KY;_2022)) defects 62% with a weatherstrip redesign and weld adjustments, achieving zero leakage. At [Coopersurgical, Inc.](https://www.coopersurgical.com/about-us/), I built the Auto Integra [ICSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection#:~:text=Intracytoplasmic%20sperm%20injection%20%28ICSI%20%2F%20%CB%88%C9%AAksi%20%2F%20IK-see%29,that%20may%20be%20transferred%20to%20a%20maternal%20uterus) micromanipulator—nailing ±2µm IVF precision with piezo actuators—showcased at an R&D summit. At RPD, LLC, I’m designing robotic hardware, refining reliability with SolidWorks and FEA. Leading NYU’s Project STEP, I’ve engineered a bipedal robots for three iterations —now in its fifth iteration. Back at Osmania, I worked as a suspension engineer for Baja Team Torque, enhancing vehicle durability 30% with FEA-optimized designs.

I'm driven to fuse hardware and software into seamless, high-impact systems. Let's revolutionize tech an change lives for good!

I am a second-year Master’s student in Mechatronics and Robotics at New York University, with a distinguished undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from Vasavi College of Engineering, India. My academic and professional journey has been driven by a passion for innovative engineering solutions and cutting-edge technology, with a strong focus on systems thinking and integration.

Throughout my career, I have accumulated valuable experience through various internships and projects. At [Coopersurgical, Inc.](https://www.coopersurgical.com/about-us/), I led the development of a novel high-precision Automated [ICSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracytoplasmic_sperm_injection#:~:text=Intracytoplasmic%20sperm%20injection%20%28ICSI%20%2F%20%CB%88%C9%AAksi%20%2F%20IK-see%29,that%20may%20be%20transferred%20to%20a%20maternal%20uterus) Micromanipulator, focusing on system-level optimization and integration to handle complex engineering challenges. My role at [KIA India](https://www.kia.com/in/home.html) involved key redesigns of the [Carens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Carens#Fourth_generation_(KY;_2022)) , where I applied a systems approach to significantly improve mechanical assemblies and defect rates. At RE Sustainability, I spearheaded initiatives at a major waste-to-energy plant, utilizing systems engineering principles to introduce drone technology for effective odor control. My time at IIT Madras Research Park was marked by engineering advancements in robot mechanics and payload capacity, emphasizing a holistic view of system performance and reliability. 

Currently, I am actively involved in Project Mjolnir at NYU, where I am working on optimizing adaptive mountain bikes for wheelchair users. This project, along with other endeavors such as designing a maze-solving device and developing a radar system for object detection, reflects my commitment to leveraging technology and a systems engineer mindset to create meaningful impact.

I am proficient in programming languages, CAD tools, and simulation software, and I approach each challenge with a systems-oriented perspective, aiming to integrate diverse components into cohesive, high-performance solutions. I am eager to continue exploring the endless possibilities technology offers to address real-world challenges. Let’s innovate together and make a difference!

I am a first year masters student majoring in [Mechatronics and Robotics](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/mechatronics-and-robotics-ms) at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), US.
I completed my undergraduate degree from [Vasavi College of Engineering](https://www.vce.ac.in/), India in Mechanical engineering with distinction.
I've always been drawn to cutting-edge projects and research which has the potential to bring meaningful change.
During my bachelor's, i interned at three organisations. I interned at [IIT Madras Research Park](https://www.iitm.ac.in/research/institute-research-centres/advanced-manufacturing-technology-development-centre) where i designed and modeled an autonomous cotton crop harvesting robot. 
Not stopping there, I extended my skills to the realm of sustainability, devising solutions at a [waste-to-energy conversion plant](https://resustainability.com/) in South India. I figured and drafted an innovative way to spray 75lts of liquid odorite through drones.
I also interned at [KIA India Pvt Ltd](https://www.kia.com/in/home.html) where i played a pivotal role in reducing the Defects per Unit (DPU) and optimising [KIA Carens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Carens#Fourth_generation_(KY;_2022)) by redesigning the tailgate and weatherstrip.
My current venture involves optimizing adaptive mountain bikes for wheelchair users in a collaborative international effort known as Project Mjolnir at NYU.

Hobbies- Trekking, hiking, roller skating, photography, painting

From projects like Driver Drowsiness Detection to the Exploration of Robotics Sword Kinematics, my journey has been marked by a passion for leveraging technology for real-world solutions.
Proficient in programming languages, CAD tools, and simulation software, I am excited about the endless possibilities technology offers to address the challenges of our time. Let's innovate together!

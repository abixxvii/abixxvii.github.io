I am a first year masters student majoring in Mechatronics and Robotics at New York University, US.
I completed my undergraduate degree from Vasavi College of Engineering, India in Mechanical engineering with distinction.
I've always been drawn to cutting-edge projects and research which has the potential to bring meaningful change.
During my bachelor's, i interned at three organisations. I interned at IIT Madras Research Park where i designed and modeled an autonomous cotton crop harvesting robot. 
Not stopping there, I extended my skills to the realm of sustainability, devising solutions at a waste-to-energy conversion plant in South India. I figured and drafted an innovative way to spray 75lts of liquid odorite through drones.
I also interned at KIA India Pvt Ltd where i played a pivotal role in reducing the Defects per Unit (DPU) and optimising KIA Carens by redesigning the tailgate and weatherstrip.
My current venture involves optimizing adaptive mountain bikes for wheelchair users in a collaborative international effort known as Project Mjolnir at NYU.

Hobbies- Hiking, roller skating, photography, painting

From projects like Driver Drowsiness Detection to the Exploration of Robotics Sword Kinematics, my journey has been marked by a passion for leveraging technology for real-world solutions.
Proficient in programming languages, CAD tools, and simulation software, I am excited about the endless possibilities technology offers to address the challenges of our time. Let's innovate together!

I’m a recent grad with a Master's in Mechatronics & Robotics at NYU, with a First-Class BE in Mechanical Engineering from Osmania University, India. I specialize in turning visionary ideas into reality. I love to take stuff from 0→1 (concept to prototype) and scaling them 1→n (prototype to mass deployment) across automotive, brain-computer interfaces, healthcare, wearables, and humanoid systems.

I’ve stacked hands-on wins across diverse roles. Interned in the automotive, medtech, sustainability, and consumer industries. I’ve worked with industry giants like [Coopersurgical, Inc.](https://www.coopersurgical.com/about-us/) and [KIA India](https://www.kia.com/in/home.html), and took full ownership of design-to-manufacturing (high volume) at a startup in Spring '25. Across the board, I delivered high-impact results that truly moved the needle.

 I’m passionate about building across disciplines. I enjoy wearing multiple hats. whether it’s designing, fabricating, testing, or working closely with teammates to get things done. I bring curiosity, precision, and energy to every project I take on.

I'm driven to fuse hardware and software into seamless, high-impact systems.

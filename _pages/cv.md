# Experience

### RPD, LLC  
**Mechanical Engineering Intern**  
_Easton, United States — Jan 2025 – May 2025_  
- Led mechanical design and validation across 5+ client projects, owning cradle-to-grave development of high-volume, production-ready components using injection molding, CNC, and sheet metal.  
- Designed test fixtures for V&V and a chip-on-glass LED illumination device for a biosafety cabinet, optimizing thermal dissipation by 78% and simplifying assembly to drive down COGS.  
- Negotiated with U.S. contract manufacturers to avoid tariffs, cut launch timelines by 80%, and reduce cost by 25%; coordinated DFMA with vendors and prepared 2D drawings and BOMs.

### CooperSurgical, Inc  
**New Product Development Intern (R&D)**  
_Trumbull, United States — May 2024 – Aug 2024_  
- Initiated and prototyped Auto Integra, an automated ICSI micromanipulator with ±2µm precision and CV-based embryo segmentation; improved conception rates by 126.2%.  
- Engineered a magnet-Hall sensor system to detect IVF incubator lid position, optimizing Neodymium magnet placement to improve gas purge efficiency by 83%.  
- Authored bench test protocols, led usability studies, and supported packaging for Class III IUDs in cross-functional FDA NDA-stage projects.

### Kia India Pvt. Ltd.  
**Vehicle Quality & Engineering Intern**  
_Ananthapur, India — Feb 2023 – May 2023_  
- Eliminated critical water leakage in Kia Carens by redesigning weatherstrip geometry, tailgate alignment, and drip channels; reduced defect rate from 62% to 0.  
- Reduced Kia Seltos cowl assembly time by 40% through interface redesign; validated through thermal chamber testing and failure analysis.  
- Boosted First Time Yield by over 70% and improved OEE by resolving sealing variation via die correction and SPC-based process control.

### RE Sustainability Ltd.  
**Engineering Intern**  
_Hyderabad, India — Jul 2022 – Aug 2022_  
- Evaluated RDF feed properties (moisture content, calorific value) to improve combustion efficiency, enhancing boiler thermal stability by 10%.  
- Supported deployment of a drone-based deodorization system through field validation, route mapping, and odor monitoring, cutting complaints by 60%.

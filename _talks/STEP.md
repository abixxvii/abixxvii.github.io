Project STEP began as a scrappy capstone project at NYU. We were a group of curious engineers trying to build humanoid robots that could walk. No frills, just a mission to make something move. Over time, it grew into a formal student team where both undergraduates and graduate students could contribute through a credit-bearing course or as volunteers.

As the inaugural team lead, I focused on the mechanical design and development of the next generation of bipeds, using insights from previous failures to create more modular, manufacturable systems. At the same time, I took on team operations, marketing, fundraising, budgeting, and mentoring a vertically integrated group of students from different academic levels.

I successfully secured sponsorships and raised funds, including a significant hardware grant from SendCutSend. This allowed us to move from 3D-printed prototypes to robust, CNC-machined and sheet metal designs, which elevated the quality and realism of our robots.

I personally designed, built, and tested multiple robots that combined carbon fiber, 3D printing, and machined components. I am now leading development on a 12-degree-of-freedom biped designed for easy fabrication, quick assembly, and future research adaptability.

I also introduced topology optimization and DFMA principles to improve performance and accelerate iteration. Today, STEP is not just a project but a living robotics platform that blends real-world engineering, collaboration, and student-led innovation.


## Design Philosophy & Inspiration

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src='/images/inspo.png' width='400'/>
</div>

*This image highlights the elegance and complexity of the human body. My goal was to design a biped that could realistically mimic human locomotion â€” not just functionally, but in its proportions, modularity, and physical expression.*

The core design philosophy behind STEP is grounded in **bio-inspiration** and **iterative prototyping**.

*This bot was designed using a hybrid approach: sheet metal fabrication for structural components, CNC machining for precision parts, and 3D printing for rapid prototyping.*

## Previous Versions

*The 6 DOF bot used carbon fiber-reinforced links and ABS 3D-printed parts. It served as an early prototype that informed later design choices.*

## Current Status

We are currently **fabricating the latest generation of bipeds**, including a finalized 13 DOF robot and an upgraded 12 DOF variant with modular joints and better ankle articulation. These are designed to be **easily manufacturable**, **research-adaptable**, and **control-system ready**.

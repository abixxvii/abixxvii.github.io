The goal of the STEP project is to create and optimize a biped capable of intelligent and dynamic locomotion.

I lead the new phase of the stair traversal and exploration platform, focusing on building bipedal robots from the ground up using both 3D printing and machining techniques.

Previously, I collaborated with the inception team towards the end of their tenure and now oversee this new phase. The team successfully developed 2, 4, 6, and 10 DOF robots (with 8 active and 2 passive degrees of freedom).

Currently, I am spearheading the development of a 12 DOF biped and experimenting with upgrading the existing 6 DOF model to 8 DOF by adding ankle actuation in the pitch direction.

1. **_[12 DOF Bi-Ped Design Overview]_**:

The 12 DOF biped will feature 6 DOF per leg, including:
- Hip: 3 DOF (yaw, roll, pitch).
- Knee: 1 DOF (pitch).
- Ankle: 2 DOF (pitch, roll).

**Torso Functionality:**
- The torso will house and secure essential components, including:
Battery.
Depth camera.
Onboard computer.
Miscellaneous items.

**Manufacturing Techniques:**
- 3D Printing: Chosen for rapid prototyping and quick iteration of designs.
- Machining: Selected for critical components to ensure durability and longevity.
  
**Topology Optimization:**
- Implementing topology optimization techniques to reduce weight while maintaining structural integrity.
- Enhancing performance through efficient material distribution in the robot's design by GD&T and DFMA principles.

**Legged Locomotion Controls:**
- Learning and implementing advanced control algorithms for legged locomotion to enable stable and adaptive movement.
  
**Iterative Development Process:**
- Continuous testing and refinement of designs based on performance feedback.

2. **_[Experimentation]_**
   - Experimenting with the existing 6 DOF biped to convert it into an 8 DOF model.
   - Actuating the 4-bar parallel linkage to enhance ankle movement.

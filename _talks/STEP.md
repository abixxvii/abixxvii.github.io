The goal of the STEP project is to create and optimize a biped capable of intelligent and dynamic locomotion.

I lead the new phase of the stair traversal and exploration platform, focusing on building bipedal robots from the ground up using both 3D printing and machining techniques.

Previously, I collaborated with the inception team towards the end of their tenure and now oversee this new phase. We have successfully developed 2, 4, 6, and 10 DOF robots (with 8 active and 2 passive degrees of freedom).

Currently, I am spearheading the development of a 12 DOF biped and experimenting with upgrading the existing 6 DOF model to 8 DOF by adding ankle actuation in the pitch direction.

1. [12 DOF Bi-Ped] Design Overview:

The 12 DOF biped will feature 6 DOF per leg, including:
- Hip: 3 DOF (yaw, roll, pitch).
- Knee: 1 DOF (pitch).
- Ankle: 2 DOF (pitch, roll).

Torso Functionality:
- The torso will house and secure essential components, including:
Battery.
Depth camera.
Onboard computer.
Miscellaneous items.

Manufacturing Techniques:
- 3D Printing: Chosen for rapid prototyping and quick iteration of designs.
- Machining: Selected for critical components to ensure durability and longevity.
  
Focus on Mobility:
- Emphasis on creating a biped capable of intelligent and dynamic locomotion.
  
Iterative Development Process:
- Continuous testing and refinement of designs based on performance feedback.

2. [Experimentation]
   - Experimenting with the existing 6 DOF biped to convert it into an 8 DOF model.
   - Actuating the 4-bar parallel linkage to enhance ankle movement.

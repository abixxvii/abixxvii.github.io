### Overview
I’m contributing to an open-source, open-architecture auricular vagus nerve stimulator project that’s being developed collaboratively through a distributed model. The team is coordinating on GitHub, and I’m involved as a contributor

Auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS) is a technique that uses gentle electrical pulses on nerves around the ear to activate the vagus nerve. This can help shift the body’s balance by lowering “fight-or-flight” activity and supporting more of a “rest-and-digest” state. Researchers have been looking at aVNS for different health conditions like depression, withdrawal, chronic pain, and digestive issues. It’s also been explored in wellness for things like stress relief.

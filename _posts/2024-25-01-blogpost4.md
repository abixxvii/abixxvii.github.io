1. **Level 0 - No Automation:**
   - Traditional vehicles without any advanced driver assistance features.
   - Examples: Basic economy cars without features like adaptive cruise control or lane-keeping assistance.

2. **Level 1 - Driver Assistance:**
   - Vehicles with basic driver assistance features.
   - Examples: Cars equipped with adaptive cruise control or automatic emergency braking.

3. **Level 2 - Partial Automation:**
   - Cars capable of simultaneously controlling steering and acceleration/deceleration under certain conditions.
   - Examples: Tesla's Autopilot, Audi's Traffic Jam Assist, or GM's Super Cruise.

4. **Level 3 - Conditional Automation:**
   - Vehicles capable of managing most driving tasks under specific conditions.
   - Examples: Audi A8 with Traffic Jam Pilot (limited to specific conditions), although Level 3 systems are not widely available yet.

5. **Level 4 - High Automation:**
   - Cars capable of fully autonomous driving in specific conditions or environments.
   - Examples: Waymo's autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services in geo-fenced areas, or some autonomous shuttles used in controlled environments.

6. **Level 5 - Full Automation:**
   - Fully autonomous vehicles that can handle all driving tasks in any condition without human intervention.
   - As of my last update in January 2022, there were no widely available Level 5 vehicles for consumer use. Development and testing were ongoing in various companies, including Waymo, Tesla, and others.

However, It's important to note that the availability and deployment of autonomous features may vary by region due to regulatory considerations, and advancements in autonomous technology continue to progress. 
Always refer to the latest information from manufacturers (OEM's) and regulatory bodies for the most up-to-date details.

      Interned at Kia India’s Vehicle Quality & Engineering division during the launch phase of the India-specific Kia Carens. Worked on-site at a high-capacity plant producing over 300,000 vehicles annually, supporting model-specific quality improvements across multiple lines.

      I played a key role in resolving a critical tailgate water leakage issue on the Kia Carens, traced to geometric misalignments and weld-induced warpage. Using structured failure analysis tools like SPC, 7 QC methods, and fishbone diagrams, I helped redesign the weatherstrip, shift tailgate mounting points, optimize the drip channel layout, and revise weld locations. These changes reduced the defect rate from 62% to 0% and were validated through leak and statistical testing.

      I also addressed a cowl fitment issue in the Kia Seltos, reducing assembly time by 40% through design optimization. My work further improved First Time Yield by over 70% and contributed to higher OEE by supporting die corrections and supplier process improvements. This internship was recognized as the best capstone project in my cohort.

Working with an international team along with Noel Joyce and Phil Caridi to re-design and optimize an adaptable mountain bike.

This is a modular bike which is designed specifically to wwheelchair users.

Project Mjolnir is an open-source project which aims to build an open-source adaptable mountain bike for wheelchair users. The primary objective of which is to introduce a modular platform that is upgradeable over time for the user as well as being cost effective to do so. Many technical issues have been addressed but it is anticipated there will be more after testing. Due to the modularity of the system it will need research and design work carried out to create the different components.

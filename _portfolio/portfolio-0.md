**Project: Automated ICSI Micromanipulator (Fly By Wire)**

Developed an automated system for the ICSI micromanipulator, integrating precise piezo-actuators and advanced segmentation capabilities.
Showcased at an upcoming healthcare summit, this innovation has the potential to revolutionize Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).
One of the standout features of this system is its ability to move with submicron precision, allowing for unprecedented control and accuracy. But what's more, this precision can be manually overridden, giving users the flexibility to adjust the system to their specific needs.
As an add-on to the existing lever, this automated system seamlessly integrates with current workflows. With its advanced capabilities and precision, this innovation has the potential to significantly improve ICSI success rates and revolutionize the field of ART.

Key benefits of this system include:

- Submicron precision movement, allowing for unparalleled control and accuracy
- Manual override capability, giving users flexibility and customization options
- Advanced segmentation capabilities, enabling more precise and efficient procedures
- Seamless integration with existing mechanism, minimizing disruption to current workflows

**Project: Fan and Temperature Module Revamp for the Advanced Micromanipulator**

Redesigned two modules into a single, integrated unit, optimizing performance without compromising functionality.

**
Project: Hall Sensor Test, magnet selection and Fixture Development**

Designed and developed a specialized fixture for testing hall sensors in an incubator environment, ensuring precise functionality and reliability.

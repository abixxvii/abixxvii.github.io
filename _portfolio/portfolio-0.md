Collaborated with XFN teams, worked on multiple projects. Some notable projects include,

**Project 1: Automated ICSI Micromanipulator (Fly By Wire) AKA Auto Integra**

Developed an automated system for the ICSI micromanipulator RI Integra 3, integrating precise piezo-actuators and advanced segmentation capabilities.
Showcased at an upcoming healthcare summit, this innovation has the potential to revolutionize Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).
One of the standout features of this system is its ability to move with submicron precision, allowing for unprecedented control and accuracy. But what's more, the lever can still retains it's function and can be manually overridable, giving users the flexibility to adjust the system to their specific needs.
As an add-on to the existing micromanipulator, this automated system seamlessly integrates with current workflows. With its advanced capabilities and precision, this innovation has the potential to significantly improve ICSI success rates and revolutionize the field of ART.

Key benefits of this system include:

- Submicron precision movement, allowing for unparalleled control and accuracy
- Manual override capability, giving users flexibility and customization options
- Advanced segmentation capabilities, enabling more precise and efficient procedures
- Seamless integration with existing mechanism, minimizing disruption to current workflows

The system was demoed at an R&D summit for it's impact and potential to ease and improve the IVF process.

**Project 2: Fan and Temperature Module Revamp for the Advanced Micromanipulator**

Redesigned two modules into a single, integrated unit, optimizing performance without compromising functionality.


**Project 3: Hall Sensor Test, magnet selection and Fixture Development**

Designed and developed a specialized fixture for testing hall sensors on the IVF workstation, ensuring precise functionality and reliability.

Cannot add images or videos of any project due to NDA.

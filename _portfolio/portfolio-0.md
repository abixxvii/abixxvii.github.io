Contributed to multiple FDA-compliant medical device projects within CooperSurgicalâ€™s cutting-edge R&D division. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to support system design, bench testing, and reliability validation per ISO standards.

Most notably, I initiated and prototyped Auto Integra, a "fly-by-wire" ICSI micromanipulator add-on offering submicron precision, advanced segmentation, manual override, and seamless integration with existing IVF workflows. Demoed internally, it has the potential to significantly enhance Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART).

Other impactful work includes redesigning thermal and airflow modules, optimizing Neodymium magnet placement for hall-sensor detection, and developing test rigs for system-level V&V. I also authored several bench test protocols, supported usability studies, and contributed to packaging design for Class III medical devices. While media is restricted due to NDA, these projects gave me deep exposure to electromechanical systems and clinical-grade device development.

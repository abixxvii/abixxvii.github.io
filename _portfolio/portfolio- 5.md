      Interned at IIT Madras as a project lead, where I spearheaded a five-member team to design and prototype an autonomous cotton crop harvester under the mentorship of Dr. Shital Chiddarwar and AMTDC.

      Drawing inspiration from planetary rovers, we developed a rugged robotic platform using mecanum wheels for omnidirectional mobility and integrated a 6-DOF robotic arm optimized for payload and reach. The system was designed to navigate uneven agricultural terrain and perform selective harvesting tasks with high precision.

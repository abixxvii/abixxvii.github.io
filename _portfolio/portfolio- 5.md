      Interned at IIT Madras in collaboration with AMTDC, where I led a five-member team to design and prototype an autonomous cotton crop harvester under the mentorship of Dr. Shital Chiddarwar.

      Inspired by planetary rovers, we developed a rugged mobile platform with mecanum wheels for omnidirectional motion and integrated a 6-DOF robotic arm tailored for field-level precision. The system was built to traverse uneven terrain and perform selective harvesting with adaptability and accuracy.
